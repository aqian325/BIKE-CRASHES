      <p>In the 83 stories collected in the <span class="orange-word">Scary Moments Project</span>...<br>
        "bike lanes" were mentioned 69 times. <br><br>
        How do we measure the impact of bike lanes in light of these stories?

      <p>In the 83 stories collected in the <span class="orange-word">Scary Moments Project</span>...<br>
        "car door" was mentioned 17 times. <br><br>
        This means that over 18% people who wrote in to the Scary Moments <br>
        project mentioned the phrase “car door.” <br><br>
        “Dooring” refers to the act of opening a motor vehicle door <br>
        into the path of another road user – oftentimes, that other road user is a cyclist.

  <h3 >How can we prevent bike crashes? </h3>
  <p>Research has shown that bicycle helmets, fluorescent clothing, <br>
    and active lighting on bikes can reduce injuries and fatalities to bicyclists.<br><br>
    Aside from these individual measures, the magnitude of bicycle-motorist collisions calls for infrastructural changes.

  <p>In 2019, Cambridge passed the <span class="blue-word">CYCLING SAFETY ORDINANCE</span>, <br>
    which laid out a plan to install a 25-mile network of protected bicycle lanes <br>
    across the city by 2026.<br><br>
    As of December 2023, according to the City of Cambridge’s Cycling Safety Ordinance webpage, <br>
    <span class="blue-word">12.64 miles</span> of bike lanes have been installed. <br><br>
    That is <span class="blue-word">56%</span> of the 22.6 miles of bike lanes that the Ordinance plans to install by 2026.
