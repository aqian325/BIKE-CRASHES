      <p>First responders are called to 160 crashes every year <br>
        involving a person on a bike being struck by a car, <br>

      <p>In 2019, Cambridge passed the <span class="blue-word">CYCLING SAFETY ORDINANCE</span>, <br>
        which laid out a plan to install a 25-mile network of protected bicycle lanes <br>
        across the city by 2026, with yearly milestones and deadlines.</p>

    <div class = 'slide'>
      <h3>Progress as of December 2023
      </h3>
      <p>According to the City of Cambridge’s Cycling Safety Ordinance webpage, <br>
        <span class="blue-word">12.64 miles</span> of bike lanes have been installed. <br><br>
        That is <span class="blue-word">56%</span> of the 22.6 miles of bike lanes that the Ordinance plans to install by 2026. </p>

      <p><span class="orange-word">Cambridge Bike Safety</span>, a local group advocating for the implementation <br>
        of more bike lanes in the city, initiated the <span class="orange-word">Scary Moments Project</span><br>
