      <p>In Cambridge alone, first responders are called to 160 crashes every year <br>
        involving a person on a bike being struck by a car, <br>
        according to data from the Cambridge Police Department. <br>
      What we have is likely an incomplete picture. <br><br>Many more crashes go <span class="colored-word">unreported</span>.

      <h3>
        Why is this important? 
      </h3>
      <p>Data from the CDC indicates that nearly 1,000 cyclists die and over 130,000 are injured <br>
        in crashes that occur on roads in the US every single year. <br><br>
        The cost of these tragedies is innumerable. <br>
        In monetary terms alone, bike injuries and deaths from crashes <br>
        result in losses of over $23 billion in the US each year. <br><br>
        What's more, these experiences exact an immense physical and emotional toll <br>
        on the person riding a bike, their friends, and their loved ones, <br>
        who sometimes have to deal with years of trauma or injury.      
      </p>

      <h3>
        Where and how do bike crashes occur? 
      </h3>
      <p>According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, most bike crashes occur: <br>
        [1] in urban areas <br>
        [2] on sections of roads away from intersections, where higher speeds might occur<br>
        [3] between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. <br>
        While adults ages 55 to 69 have the highest rates of bicycle deaths, <br>
        adolescents, teens, and young adults have the highest rates of bicycle-related injuries. <br><br>
        The most common types of bike crashes involve: <br>
        [1] cyclists riding through intersections and into a motor vehicle's path <br>
        [2] motor vehicles failing to yield at intersections<br>
        [3] motorists turning or merging into a parallel moving cyclist's path

      <h3 >How can we prevent bike crashes? </h3>
      <p>Research has shown that bicycle helmets, fluorescent clothing, <br>
        and active lighting on bikes can reduce injuries and fatalities to bicyclists.<br><br>
        Aside from these individual measures, the magnitude of bicycle-motorist collisions calls for infrastructural changes.

      <h3 >How can we prevent bike crashes? </h3>
      <p>In 2019, Cambridge passed the <span class="blue-word">CYCLING SAFETY ORDINANCE</span>, <br>
        which laid out a plan to install a 25-mile network of protected bicycle lanes <br>
        across the city by 2026.<br><br>
        As of December 2023, according to the City of Cambridge’s Cycling Safety Ordinance webpage, <br>
        <span class="blue-word">12.64 miles</span> of bike lanes have been installed. <br><br>
        That is <span class="blue-word">56%</span> of the 22.6 miles of bike lanes that the Ordinance plans to install by 2026.

      <h3>Scary Moments Project
      </h3>
      <p><span class="orange-word">Cambridge Bike Safety</span>, a local group advocating for the implementation <br>
        of more bike lanes in the city, initiated the <span class="orange-word">Scary Moments Project</span><br>
        in 2018 to illustrate the emotional and physical toll of these preventable crashes. <br>
        Residents and cyclists in the Cambridge area wrote in with their stories of close calls and crashes on bikes. <br>
        In total, 83 stories were submitted. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = 'slide'>
      <p>In the 83 stories collected in the <span class="orange-word">Scary Moments Project</span>...<br>
        "bike lanes" were mentioned 69 times. <br><br>
        How do we measure the impact of bike lanes in light of these stories? 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class = 'slide'>
      <p>In the 83 stories collected in the <span class="orange-word">Scary Moments Project</span>...<br>
        "car door" was mentioned 17 times. <br><br>
        This means that over 18% people who wrote in to the Scary Moments <br>
        project mentioned the phrase “car door.” <br><br>
        “Dooring” refers to the act of opening a motor vehicle door <br>
        into the path of another road user – oftentimes, that other road user is a cyclist.

    <div class = 'slide'>
      <p>In the 83 stories collected in the <span class="orange-word">Scary Moments Project</span>...<br>
        Over half of people who wrote in to the Scary Moments project mentioned Massachusetts Ave. <br>
        This is one of the busiest streets in Cambridge, and one of the most dangerous for cyclists. <br><br>
        Other frequently mentioned locations include:<br>
        Cambridge Street (17%) <br>
        Harvard Square (15%)
